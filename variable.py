# variable started
# x= 5

#how string, int, float varibale worked
# x = str(3)

#how varibale type
# x= 5
# y = 'rokib'

#varibale like a array
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)

#variable connected if variable type not match this will be not worked
# x = "Python "
